# interest-rate

Need to calculate interest for monthly and annually investments:

- Every month I create an investment with an $XXX amount.
- All investments are for 1 year with XXX% percentage.
- Each investment will be recreated with the amount and the gained intereset for example:
  Year 1: I invest $1000 MXN
  Year 2: I earn $1100 MXN, I recreate the investment with the amount $1100 MXN and so on for the next years
- All the monthly investments will be treated the same way.
- Need to calculate all the interest after XXX date and consider that the last year will only save the monthly amount not investing it.

Example:

Start Date: 1/1/2021
Years: 10
Monthly Amount: $1000 MXN
Annually Interest Percentage: 10%
So I invest $1000 with 10% interest so next year will give $1100 and will reinvest the amount with interest (compound interest)
I need to repeat this transaction everymonth for 10 years, so everymonth I will invest $1000 for 1 year with 10% interest and reinvest the amount with the interest next year.
